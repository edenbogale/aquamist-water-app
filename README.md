# 💧 AQUAMIST – Water Delivery App  
**By Eden Bogale**

> *"Clean water, delivered digitally — because every drop counts."*

A mobile application built for **Aquamist Water Company** in Nairobi to replace unreliable phone/email ordering with a **digital, user-friendly platform** — ensuring clean, safe water is just a tap away.

Aligned with **UN Sustainable Development Goal #6: Clean Water and Sanitation** — promoting equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

In Nairobi, many households and businesses depend on water delivery — but Aquamist’s manual system (phone calls, emails, paper logs) causes:
- Miscommunication and lost orders
- No real-time tracking
- Limited to office hours
- Customer frustration

This app modernizes operations, reduces human error, and builds trust through transparency.
